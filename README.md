## Importing Instructions

If you don't have Anki, download at this link https://apps.ankiweb.net/.

Before importing, you need to create a deck. Go to "Create a Deck", and choose any name for it, for example "NeuroPhys". If you ever want to edit how many repititions you get for your cards, click the gear icons next to your deck and choose to your liking.

To import, go to File->Import (or ⇧+⌘+I on Mac) and select cards.txt. Leave all the default options, except under "Deck" choose the deck you have previously created. Then click import on the top right, and you are ready to learn!
