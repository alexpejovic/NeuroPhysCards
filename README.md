# NeuroPhysCards
Anki-importable text file of flashcards for the Antkowiak portion of the Neurophysiology.

## Importing Instructions

If you don't have Anki, download at this link https://apps.ankiweb.net/.

Before importing, you need to create a deck. Go to "Create a Deck", and choose any name for it, for example "NeuroPhys". If you ever want to edit how many repititions you get for your cards, click the gear icons next to your deck and choose to your liking.

To import, go to File->Import (or ⇧+⌘+I on Mac) and select cards.txt. Leave all the default options, except under "Deck" choose the deck you have previously created. Then click import on the top right, and you are ready to learn!

## Contribution Instructions
To contribute, you can either fork the repo and send a PR, or ask me personally to become a contributor to avoid the forking process. Keep in mind the master branch is always protected so you will need to submit a PR in any case.

The best way to contribute is to add new cards directly on Anki, and when you want to share them, re-export the cards into a text file named cards.txt, overwrite the cards.txt file here, make sure the only changes are addition changes, then add, commit, and PR. Then anyone can reimport them without overlapping so long as they use the correct import settings on Anki (set the "Update" flag and not the "Duplicate" one).
