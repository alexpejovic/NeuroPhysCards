What should you do to ensure that you have pierced a neuron with an electrode?	Inject positive current and see if you observe action potentials.
What is a current-clamp recording?	A current is injected and the membrane potential's response is recorded.
What do voltage-clamp recordings allow us to measure?	The current injected by the amplifier mirrors the transient inward current caused by a neurotransmitter hypothetically opening certain ion channels.
What are electrode voltage-clamps used for today as an example?	They're used for analyzing the properties of ion channels expressed in oocytes.
What do patch-clamp recordings measure?	The currents from a small area of the cell membrane.
When is a giga-seal acheived?	When there is a very close connection between the recording pipette and the cell membrane.
What are two advantages of the giga-seal?	1. Low signal-to-noise ratio because rim current currents across the border of the recording pipette are almost absent. 2. It provides a mechanically very stable connection between the electrode and cell, allowing recordings that last up to several hours.
How to you obtain a giga-seal?	1. Push small stream of filling solution out of pipette when far away from cell. 2. Move pipette to cell membrane until you see a dimple in the cell membrane caused by pused solution. 3. Release the pressure on the pipette to cause dimple to expand and cell membrane touches tip of electrode. 4. Apply negative pressure to suck cell's cytoplasm into the recording pipette. Now resistance is in the giga-ohm range!
What are the characteristics of inside-out membrane patches?	The former intracellular surface of the cell membrane now faces the bathing solution. The surface of the cell membrane that faced the extracellular space now faces the pipette solution.
What is a common application of inside-out membrane patches?	It is much easier to change the bathing solution that the pipette solution during experiments. Therefore this configuration is well suited for the study of intracellular modulators of ion channels.
What is the crucial step that follows giga-seal formation to create an outside-out membrane patch?	The destruction of the cell membrane underneath the electrode tip opening.
What are the characteristics of an outside-out membrane patch?	The surface of the membrane patch that had faced the cytosol now faces the pipette solution and the surface of the membrane patch that faced the extracellular or bathing solution is still facing the bathing solution.
What is a typical application for outside-out patches?	The neurotransmitter binding sites are exposed to the bathing and not the pipette solution. This allows you to measure channel activity with a vareity of exposures to different neurotransmitters.
What are advantages of the cell-attached patch clamp configuration?	1. Suitable for single channel recordings 2. Intracellular modulators are present
What are disadvantages of the patch clamp cell-attached configuration?	1. Voltage gradient across the membrane is unknown 2. Intracellular concentrations of ions unknown
What are key differences between the voltage-clamp and the current-clamp?	1. Control of membrane potential. The membrane potential is controllled by the experimenter in voltage-clamp, but free running in current-clamp. 2. Behaviour of the amplifier. In voltage-clamp mode, the amplifier inject current that zeros the difference between the membrane potential and the command voltage. In current-clamp mode, the amplifier injects a command current into the neuron. 3. Applicability. A typical example of voltage-clamp recordings is the analysis of synaptic currents. In current-clamp, we map input-output relationships between input current and neuronal output behaviour.
How do you establish a current to voltage relationship for single ion channels?	1. Record single channel activity at different voltage-clamped membrane potentials. 2. The currents during the open state of the channels have to be quantified. 3. Use the pairs of voltages and currents for plotting the relationship.
What is the single channel current-voltage relationship and what does it imply?	It is linear, meaning that the conductivity of the channel is voltage independent.
How do you calculate the current across an open ion channel?	\(i_{open}=(E_m-E_{ion})g_{open}\) \(E_m\) is the membrane potential \(E_{ion}\) is the Nernst potential of permeable ions \(g_{open}\) is the conductance in the open state
How do you calculate the mean current across a single ion channel?	\(i_{mean}=i_{open}P_{open}\) \(P_{open}\) is the open probability
How does one measure the mean current across multiple ion channels?	The mean current of a single channel times the number of channels.
What are the prominent features of the bacterial KcsA potassium channel?	1. It's a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channels, allowing greater influx than efflux. 2. They have 4 identical subunits which form an ion-conducting pore in the middle of the protein complex.
How might ion channels allow selective permeation of specific ions?	One point to be considered is the that cations dissolved in water are surrounded by a hydration shell.
How do potassium selective ion channels distinguish between potassium and sodium ions?	Their size.
Why don't sodium ions pass through potassium-selective channels despite possatium being larger?	Because the interactions with the carbonyl groups lining the wall of the filter do not promote the removal of the hydration shell.

How many sodium channel subtypes are there?	10

Relating to the dehyradtion process of ions passing through the KcsA channel, how is the hydration shell progressively replaced?	By interactions with the carbonyl groups.
What is the most primitive type of ion channel and why (describe its structure)?	The KcsA potassium channel because the single protein subunits feature two transmembrane segments and one p-loop and identical 4 subunits form a functional channel.
"Describe what it means for some sodium channels to be ""voltage dependent""."	Some sodium channels can only be activated for short periods after cell depolarization (a few ms). They have to be again hyperpolarized then depolarized to be activated once again.
